Simply copy and paste the ignorelist file into your Diablo 2 install directory. 

Windows Vista and 7 64-bit systems should be: C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II
Windows XP (as well as Vista and 7 32-bit) should be: C:\Program Files\Diablo II

This ignorelist has over 2,000 lines to block quite a bit of spam and bot advertisements.
