This is only needed if you run non-English versions of D2.
(Otherwise don't worry about it.)

Instalation
1. Copy/Paste the entire data folder into your diablo 2 folder.
2. Open your manager and check the Direct txt box.


Etal will now be in English, no more language problems.
This will not effect d2 running without without the bot or if you uncheck the direct txt box in manager it will return to your normal language.
